          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Pizza Dough</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Buy Pizza Dough and roll it out
                into a circular shape on a piece of parchment paper making
                certain to keep the dough at least an 1/8 inch thick when
                flattened.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take the tomato sauce and scoop out 1/2 a cup of sauce onto the
                dough and spread it over the dough with the back of a spoon
                leaving a half inch around the perimeter for the crust.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take a handful of mozzarella cheese and spread it out over the
                sauce on the dough until the sauce is barely visible underneath.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lastly, place slices of pepperoni across the top. Place as many
                as you wish!
              </li>
              <li>
                Put in the oven for 15-25 minutes, until the cheese and edges of
                the crust are golden brown.
              </li>
              <li>Let cool for five minutes and then dig in!</li>
            </ol>
